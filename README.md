# Video Caption App

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the app.

## Technical Decisions
- **React**: For building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For easy and flexible styling.
- **react-player**: For embedding and controlling video playback.

## User Experience Considerations
- **Form Validation**: Ensures captions and timestamps are valid before submission.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes for a consistent experience.
- **Playback Control**: Allows users to control video playback for precise caption timing.

## Trade-offs
- **Limited Time**: Focused on core functionality due to the time constraint. Given more time, I would add features like editing captions and more robust error handling.

## Future Enhancements
- **Caption Editing**: Allow users to edit and delete existing captions.
- **User Authentication**: Save user data and preferences.
- **Enhanced Styling**: More sophisticated UI/UX improvements.
